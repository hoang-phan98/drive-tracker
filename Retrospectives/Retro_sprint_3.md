Retrospective - Sprint 3

| Name | Done Well | Needs Improvements |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Kenny | <ul><li>Worked on functionality rather than making it look good, which allowed the main flow to be made. Now the pages have been designed, it is easy to redesign the existing pages.</li><li>Good transfer of knowledge between the team</li></ul> | <ul><li>Velocity slowed a little bit this sprint</li><li>There were several dependencies in the sprint, which caused people to be blocked</li></ul> |
| Hoang | <ul><li>New functionalities were completed and graphs are now linked to appropriate data. Progress made is still very good considering how much time we have left</li></ul> | <ul><li>Left most of the heavylifting to Marc since I still have little clue on how to code with vue and Google API</li></ul> |
| Fenghe (Dax) Shen | <ul><li>Member contributions consistently good</li><li>Members are patient and glad to provide each other with insightful input and helpful tips</li></ul> | <ul><li>I personally did not communicate very effectively with teammates especially via standups</li><li>A few stories were left undone and pushed to the next sprint. Scoping could be better</li></ul> |
| Marc | <ul><li>still keeping pace, everyone completing their work improvement needed</li></ul> | <ul><li>some files are getting big/messy, should embrace making reusable components</li><li>much of the UI doesn't look like it does in the designs and will have to be redone</li></ul> |
| Erica | <ul><li>We’re very on track and the pace we’re working at is good</li></ul> | <ul><li>Assigning tasks more based on strengths rather than preference</li></ul> |

# Report
## Improving working as a team and enacting on previous sprint's retro
The team is happy about the project processes and seem to take note of previous sprint's shortcoming and taking clear steps to improve.
The team has also starting to collaborate more easily with each other as we learn other team member's skills and weaknesses.

## Sharing of skills within the team
Given the nature of the project, there were bound to be confusion with implementation using a completely new framework for most of the team. Sharing of information allowed the team to grow and learn, greatly improving the productivity of the team and boosting team morale.

## Use of reusable components
Now that more and more lines are being adding into each view at an exponential rate, it has been seen that a single page would contain a lot of "clutter" can be reduced into separate reusable components. Although this has become an increasingly more severe issue as we compound components in a single view, it is not practical to go back and amend what has already been made, it adds additional work that does not greatly benefit the goal of creating a high quality product. Therefore we have decided to leave the application in it's current state, but attempt to use reusable components where ever possible to prevent the problem from worsening.

## Designs and functionality
Although it can be argued that having to come back to redesign what has already been implemented is a hassle, it has to be understood that first and foremost a working product must be produced. Because of this fact, first creating the functionality on a rudimentary UI and then reimplementing the UI based on the designs was actually a more efficient strategy. It should be noted that the designs at the time of making the certain features were not yet created, instead of being blocked by designs, creating the functioning product and redesigning after the fact was logical.

This also allows the designs to be slightly modular as certain features may be found as infeasible or too difficult to implement, therefore finding these out as the designs are being created allows for the designer to make the appropriate changes before anything has been set.
