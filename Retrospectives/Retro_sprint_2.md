| Kenny | <ul><li>Estimations seem to be holding well, appropriate work allocations can be comfortably made with the current scheme</li><li>Good collaboration within the team</li></ul> | <ul><li>Daily standup messages have been less and less frequent</li><li>Requirements are not fully understood with the data to be displayed in each screen</li></ul> |
| Hoang | <ul><li>Team is working extremely well and producing high quality code which translates to a great product</li></ul> | <ul><li>Stories are often overlapping which cause one person to do another's work</li><li>I could've done more this sprint and will try to allocate more time to work on the project in future sprints</li></ul> |
| Fenghe (Dax) Shen | <ul><li>Developers responded quickly to design specification quickly</li><li>Sprint results are of relatively good quality with given time frame</li></ul> | <ul><li>Some merge conflicts exist due to branches starting at different master commit level. Project could benefit from members pulling before working on individual branch</li><li>Members could communicate with each other on what files they are working on to avoid overlapping</li></ul> |
| Marc | <ul><li>We're still working at a good pace</li><li>Everyone is getting more comfortable with the stack</li></ul> | <ul><li>Some work has been split so that additional work is needed to combine it after merge, eg. two new pages are made when we actually need to the contents of both to be on the same page</li><li>It's hard to know what I should be checking in a merge request, it would be easier if developers wrote a description of their changes and where to find them</li></ul> |
| Erica | <ul><li>Member contribution is good</li><li>We've done a lot of our project</li><li>Members are able to work together effectively</li></ul> | <ul><li>stories that block other stories could be established during sprint planning to ensure more effective collaboration and use of time</li></ul> |

# Report
## Daily standup messages
Standups have become less frequent in the chat, some days only a few participants post their standup. Because of this the team was often "stepping on each others toes" in regard to work allocation. Daily standups are an integral part of light weight methodology and continuous development. A stronger emphasis will be put on the daily standups and the Scrum Master will be actively prompting the team members for their contribution to ensure that the team is aware of what is happening within the team and collaboration can happen effortlessly.

## Allocation in sprint not sufficient/too much
There were times were team members were finding the initial workload allocated to them were either too much or too little, and a process was not outlined in the PMP that allowed the team to handle such a situation. In future sprints, a team member who has completed their allocated stories with less time than estimated, they should report back to the Team/Scrum Master where additional allocation can be made from the backlog or deloading of stories from other team members can be made.

Stories that are found to be larger than estimated are to be reported to the Team/Scrum Master. Efforts will be made to split it into smaller stories and redistributed if needed, or if the situation permits, the story can leak into the next sprint.

`(Changes will be made to the PMP to reflect these newly found processes)`

## QA process update and reassurance
Team members were not 100% confident in following the quality assurance processes that were detailed in the PMP. During the Weekly Sprint Planning/Estimations meeting, the QA process was run down step-by-step so that the team is across the practice and a higher quality product can be ensured.

## Collaboration between UI stories and Data stories
It was found that stories involving the UI and the Data were created on different views (separate pages) and it was then needed to merge the two components together which required more additional work. Collaboration is needed between the developers of each story so ensure that the development of related stories can be synchronised. This may involve 2 or more developers working on the same branch. The enforcement of daily standups will greatly improve this collaboration also.

## Prioritising stories within the sprint
Stories within the sprint should be ordered in order of importance, keeping in mind particular stories are dependent on other stories. Although efforts were made to make stories independent, this is an unavoidable fact that occurs in practice, and ordering stories within the sprint will drastically improve the work flow.
