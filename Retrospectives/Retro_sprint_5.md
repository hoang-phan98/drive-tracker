# Report
## Consistent pace has been kept
The velocity that has been kept at a consistent pace throughout the project, and still hold even as stories become deleted and more trivial tasks are at hand.

## Proper estimations have been met
As the project comes to a conclusion, it can be seen that the correct amount of estimating has been made throughout the life of the project. This is evident as there is only a couple of stories left in the final sprint and there is no extra stories and there are still stories left to be done.
