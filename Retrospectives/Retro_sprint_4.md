# Report
## Frequency of daily standups
It has been evident that the daily standups provide little to no value when participants are not currently working on the project. This has been especially noticeable this sprint as there were a lot of assessments from other units and team members has their time allocated elsewhere.

Because of this, it was determined that standups messages should occur as frequently as work is done or when someone is blocked.

## Velocity is increasing
At the start of the project an estimated velocity was calculated in order to finish the required stories at the time as a reasonable pace and more importantly, on time. The team however is working at a faster pace than expected and taking up more stories than required in a particular sprint when work was finished earlier than estimated. The pace will be maintained which will allow time in the end of the project to allow for changes and additional features from the digression of the client and possibly other stakeholders.

## Tracking of stories being completed
Currently the stories being completed in each sprint cannot be tracked from the GIT because they are managed separately and have no mechanisms to link the two systems.

In order to know which branch on the GIT corresponds to which story on the story board, the team has agreed to add the Trello (the system currently being used to track stories and bugs) URL in the merge request message of a branch.
